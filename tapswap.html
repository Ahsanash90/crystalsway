    <h1>Tapswap</h1>
    <p>Tapswap is a mining board on Telegram that has been facilitating mining for a considerable time. Initially, there were only a few participants, but the number has rapidly increased over time. The number of tasks has grown exponentially, leading to more opportunities for coin mining and daily boosters to mine additional coins. Coins in Tapswap are mined by tapping.</p>
    <p>In Tapswap, users watch videos from the Tapswap YouTube channel to obtain redeemable codes. By entering these codes into Tapswap, users can redeem a significant number of coins, typically ranging from 200,000 to 400,000. Redemption can only occur after watching the videos; attempting to redeem without watching will result in an error.</p>
    <p>Currently, there is no official news from Tapswap regarding when these coins will be launched, but there is hope for a launch on major exchanges, particularly Binance and OKX. Following the launch, mining may cease, and there is speculation about the start of Season 2. Once the Tapswap coin is listed, its price may initially drop quickly due to the large number of coins mined early on. As awareness of the listing grows, many users may resume mining, leading to a sudden influx of sales and a rapid decline in price.</p>
