    <h1>What is Bitget?</h1>
    <p>Founded in 2018, Bitget is a global cryptocurrency exchange that caters to various merchants and is dedicated to continuous improvement.</p>
    <img src="bitget1.jpeg" alt="img" style="height: 22rem; display: flex; justify-self: center;">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>The trading strategy and workings of Bitget are quite straightforward as users can buy and sell their preferred cryptocurrencies and register their profit and loss in their accounts. On the other hand, futures trading opens the clients to high risk of loss exposure, especially while trading pairs like BTC/USD or ETH/USDT on a leverage limit of as high as 125x.</p>
    <p>What we feel is one of the best offerings from Bitget is the copy trading feature, which allows less knowledgeable users to execute profitable trades in the way more knowledgeable users do â€“ by letting them copy the effective strategies. Thus, users can choose, depending on the risk appetite level and the level of trade experience.</p>
    <p>Bitget's trading component functions as a community selling platform, promoting simple copy trading so traders can share market insights and practical wisdom to enhance their trading strategies. Additionally, users can generate passive income through Bitget's Staking and Swimming programs, which offer specific cryptocurrencies and interest rates to encourage user engagement and confidence.</p>

    <h2>Security Purpose</h2>
    <p>Bitget utilizes a tiered fee structure for trading, where a fixed amount of BGBT is not managed for the trading crowd and platform. Trading fees vary depending on the user's trading activity. Bitget operates with its own liquidity token, BGD, which serves various purposes, including easing trading operations, reducing fees, and launching bid coins.</p>
    <p>The buying and selling of different cryptocurrencies occur on the same exchange, with specific terms, conditions, and privacy policies in place to connect users with the platform while offering a reliable system.</p>
