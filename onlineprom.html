    <h1>Social Marketing</h1>
    <p>Social marketing means presenting and peddling some commodity while making the target ultimately feel as though they must buy it. This is marketing, and there is a way to do it. There are different ways of marketing, and there is someone who has mastered these marketing tactics. That somebody is a marketer. Marketing is a learned ability that aids in enabling people to market their products effectively.</p>
    <p>There are many social media platforms where we can do marketing. These platforms includes Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube. These platforms attract a large number of customers. It is common for marketers to subcontract some professionals to assist in advertising their goods and pay them a fee. One of the standard strategies is using Meta ads which include Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and Messenger Ads. These social networks use their usersâ€™ preferences to display these ads and show them products that might be of interest to them.</p>
