    <h1>Freelancer</h1>
    <p>Freelancer is a very large platform that provides a lot of facilities to freelancers. It is a bigger freelancing platform than Fiverr. Here freelancers can upload their gigs, attract clients, and take orders. Often, freelancers get their permanent jobs if they provide the things according to their work preferences, deliver them on time, and ensure proper payment. Clients should make payments on time to avoid any security issues.</p>

    <h2>How to Get Safe and Secure Payments</h2>
    <p>The way to get the most secure payment on Freelancer is to provide your client with their item as per their requirement and deliver it at the specified time. After that, the client will review your item, and if they like it, they will make the payment. Otherwise, they will give you instructions to make adjustments, and you will be paid for it. Both the client and freelancer should agree to pay in accordance with Freelancer's policies and use a third-party app preferably. All work should be conducted on or within the Freelancer platform, and avoid using any other third-party platforms to comply with Freelancer's policies.</p>
