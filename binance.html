</ol>

<h2>How to trade better on Binance?</h2>
<p>You now have an account. Let's talk about how to trade well. Being a professional takes time, but with practice, you will get there!</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Learn the Basics of Business</strong>
        <p>Before starting into complicated transactions, it's important to understand the basics. For example, learn the difference between a Market Order (buy/sell at the current price). Binance has many helpful resources to help you learn, so take your time and soak it all in.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start small</strong>
        <p>Don't put a lot of money into trading right away. It is recommended to start with a small amount of money. Binance allows you to trade in different amounts of cryptocurrencies, so you do not need to spend a lot of money. Start slowly, build confidence, and grow as you learn.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Manage your risk</strong>
        <p>Every professional trader knows the importance of risk management. This means that you do not bet everything in one trade. One way to manage risk is to create a stop loss. If the price falls below a certain level, Stop-Loss will automatically sell your cryptocurrency, causing you huge losses. Another strategy is to set a profit point so that the price reaches the target and automatically locks in profits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep Learning</strong>
        <p>The cryptocurrency market moves quickly. Therefore, it is important to stay updated. Follow the news, read articles, and learn new trading strategies. Binance has its own Academy with many tutorials, so you can learn at your own pace. The more knowledge you have, the better you'll be at spotting opportunities and making smart trades.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to protect your money from loss on Binance?</h2>
<p>The market can be volatile, and sometimes prices can fluctuate unexpectedly. So how can you protect yourself from big losses?</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Use Stop-Loss and Take-Profit orders</strong>
        <p>These orders help you to save a large amount of money. If the price drops too low, a stop loss order will automatically sell your cryptocurrency, helping you avoid big losses. Similarly, a Take-Profit order will lock in your profit once you reach your price target. Using these two tools gives you control.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Avoid using too much leverage</strong>
        <p>Binance offers margin trading, which allows you to borrow more money to trade. Although it may seem like a good way to make more money, trading on margin is risky. If the market goes in the wrong direction, you may lose more than you invested. As a newbie, it is best to avoid margin trading until you have more experience.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Diversify your investments</strong>
        <p>Don't spend all your money in one cryptocurrency. Instead, diversify your investments across multiple assets. If one of your currencies is undervalued, other investments can help maintain balance. Think of it as not putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don't let your emotions take over</strong>
        <p>Feeling like (fear of missing out) can cause many issues in your progress. The key is to stick to your plan. If the market is falling or there is big news, don't make hasty decisions. Trust your research and follow your strategy. Emotional trading rarely leads to success.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Secure your account</strong>
        <p>Finally, make sure your Binance account is secure. Use a strong password, enable two-factor authentication to secure your account from hackers, and double-check that you are on the official Binance website, especially when logging in or withdrawing.</p>
    </li>
